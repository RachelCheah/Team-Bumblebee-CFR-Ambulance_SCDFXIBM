### Short Description

#### What's the Problem?

As of 1st April 2019, SCDF officially announced that it will no longer take non-emergency patients to hospitals in their ambulances. Hoping to focus emergency vehicle manpower allocation on emergency incidents, it ceased this operation. With this, people with non-emergency conditions need to find their own mode of transport to reach the nearest hospital. This is especially difficult for populations such as the elderly, who, when ill, may not be able to travel to a hospital on their own.

#### How can technology help?

Location services technology on smartphones & IoT can be used in real-time to share the data with nearby available smartphone users of the situation faced by the non-emergency patient.

#### The idea

SCDF currently uses an app called myResponder to encourage certified Community First Responders (CFRs) to respond to nearby fire and medical cases, and thereby save lives. We propose creating an extended feature of myResponder that alerts nearby certified CFRs of the situation, encouraging them to help transport non-emergency patients to hospitals, should the non-emergency patient require assistance.
